Using a file per function can be a good practice **only in certain scenarios**, but it's not a one-size-fits-all approach. It depends on the complexity and scale of your project. Here's a breakdown:

---

### **When to Use a File per Function**
1. **Large Codebase**:
   - When your project grows, organizing functions into separate files can improve readability and maintainability.
   - Example: Each function is part of a larger module (e.g., `orders.py`, `quotes.py`, `options.py`).

2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - If functions serve distinct purposes or domains, keeping them in separate files can help maintain a clean architecture.
   - Example: A microservices architecture where each service has its own set of files.

3. **Frequent Changes**:
   - When certain functions are updated more frequently, separating them reduces merge conflicts in collaborative environments.

4. **Code Reusability Across Projects**:
   - If a function might be reused in multiple projects, keeping it in a standalone file or as part of a library makes it easier to share.

---

### **When Not to Use a File per Function**
1. **Small Projects**:
   - For small projects or scripts, splitting every function into its own file can be overkill and reduce readability.
   - Example: A script that runs in one file without excessive complexity.

2. **Overhead in Navigation**:
   - Too many small files can make navigating the project tedious and decrease development speed.

3. **Contextual Functions**:
   - If functions are tightly coupled and work together closely, keeping them in the same file makes sense for context.

---

### **Best Practices for Organization**
1. **Group by Modules or Features**:
   - Instead of one file per function, group related functions in a single file.
   - Example: 
     - `quotes.py` for `get_market_quotes`
     - `options.py` for `get_option_chains`
     - `orders.py` for `place_order` and `get_orders`.

2. **Use `__init__.py` for Modules**:
   - Organize functions into packages by feature or domain for clean imports:
     ```
     api/
       __init__.py
       quotes.py
       options.py
       orders.py
     ```

3. **Stay Flexible**:
   - Start with grouped functions, and only refactor into separate files when the complexity justifies it.

---

### Recommendation for Your Case
Given your script:
- Start by grouping related functions into files based on their domain (e.g., market quotes, options, orders).
- Expand to separate files per function **only if the project grows significantly** or functions become highly complex.
